# Machine Learning Project Structure

Having a well-organized general Machine Learning project structure makes it easy to understand and make changes.
Here is the full structure for future reference:

## Project Directory Structure

```
├── Machine Learning Project Structure <- Project Main Directory
│   ├── data <- data in different format
|   |   ├── external <- data from third party source
|   |   ├── interim <- Intermediate data that has been transformed
|   |   ├── processed <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling
|   |   ├── raw <- The original, immutable data dump
```

\***\*Note\*\***: The `data` folder and `.env` file won’t appear in github. It will be in your local folder. This is not pushed to githhub as it will be in the ignore list (`.gitignore` file). If you want to checkin that also, just comment out in `.gitignore` file and add the data folder to github.
