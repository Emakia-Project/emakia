# 🧠 Multi-Agent Analyzer for Toxicity, Bias & Misinformation

*(Built with Google ADK)*

This project is a multi-agent system built using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini Flash, developed for \[Hackathon Name]. It automates the detection of **toxicity**, **bias**, and **misinformation** from real-world sources (e.g., Reddit, Maxnews) and optionally derives further insights via BigQuery.

The app uses **Streamlit** for its interactive frontend, with each processing step modularized into ADK-compliant agents for extensibility, transparency, and replicability.

## 📌 Features

* 🤖 **LLM Agents** powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash
* 🧠 **Sequential and Parallel Execution** using Google ADK
* 📊 **BigQuery Integration** (optional) for trend analytics
* 📰 **Live Data Sources** like Reddit and news scrapers
* 📦 **Plug-and-Play Setup** via `.env` configuration
* 📺 **Demo-Ready** through an interactive Streamlit UI

## 🧪 Local Setup

### 1. Clone & Enter the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adk-hackathon-streamlit.git
cd adk-hackathon-streamlit
```

### 2. Create Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your API keys and credentials inside .env
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Fetching

Fetches the latest Reddit posts (e.g., `/r/politics`) and headlines from Maxnews.

### Sequential Agent Chain

Processes each item using a chain of LLM agents:

* `ToxicityAnalyst`
* `BiasAnalyst`
* `MisinformationAnalyst`

### (Optional) BigQuery Agent

Aggregates high-risk patterns into data queries for trend summarization and analysis.

### UI Output

Displays real-time per-item analysis within the Streamlit app.
Logs are persisted for review, validation, or scoring.
